    <h1>What do you know about ü•ê?</h1>
    <p>
      A fun fact about croissants is that despite being a symbol of French
      cuisine, their origins are actually linked to Austria. The pastry was
      inspired by the "kipferl," a crescent-shaped Austrian pastry that dates
      back to at least the 13th century. Legend has it that the croissant was
      created to celebrate the defeat of the Ottoman Turks in the Siege of
      Vienna in 1683, with the shape representing the crescent on the Turkish
      flag.</p>

      <p> However, it wasn't until the 20th century that the flaky, buttery
      version of the croissant we know today became popular in France, thanks to
      the work of French bakers who perfected the technique of laminating the
      dough with butter to create its distinctive layers. Now, the croissant is
      an essential part of French "p√¢tisserie" and a staple of French
      breakfasts.
